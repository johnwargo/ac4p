# Apache Cordova 4 Programming

This repository contains the source code for the application projects highlighted in [Apache Cordova 4 Programming](www.cordova4programming.com). The application projects included herein were created for Cordova 4.0.

There are a lot of code snippets throughout the book; that code is not included here. What's here is all of the complete application examples included in the book.

The repository contains project files from the following chapters:

* Chapter 1: Introduction
* Chapter 2: Anatomy of a Cordova Application
* Chapter 5: Mechanics of Cordova Development
* Chapter 6: Automation and the Cordova Development Process
* Chapter 11: Windows 8 Development with Cordova
* Chapter 12: Using PhoneGap Build

* Chapter 15: Cordova Development End to End
* Chapter 16: Creating Cordova Plugins 
* Chapter 17: Using Third-Party Frameworks with Cordova
* Chapter 18: Using Third-Party Tools with Cordova

In this main folder, there are two files:

* `jshint.txt` - this file contains settings I included at the top of most JavaScript files to instruct `jshint` to ignore some of the Cordova objects used by many of my applications.  
* `onerror.js` - Contains the source code for a simple JavaScript onerror function that I use to catch coding errors in my Cordova applications.
